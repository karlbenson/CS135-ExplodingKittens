# CS135-ExplodingKittens
A repository of our CMSC 135 final project using learnings from Network Technologies. This program uses the TCP protocol for management of the chat inside the game. It was made to make the Exploding Kittens game from scratch by using networks. All rules of the game in 2018 were applied here.
